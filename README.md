# Angular2+ Firebase Authentication

This project is to demonstrate how to use Firebase SDK to handle authentication flow in Angular2+ web app.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.

## Dependencies

I tried to limit the numbers of dependency. So far, the only two real dependencies are [Firebase](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk) and the [MaterialDesign](https://github.com/angular/material2) (for some aesthetics).

## Todos

## Further help

Fore more information about Firebase SDK, check out the [API Documentations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/node/) or [Github Source](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk)

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
